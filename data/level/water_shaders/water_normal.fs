     water surface, this is also valid in object space, because our
     surface is flat on Z=const (and relation of xy to texture st doesn't
     really matter, as it's just a noise for waves, doesn't matter much
     how we map it). So simply transforming by normal_matrix gets us
     into eye-space, and we're happy. */
